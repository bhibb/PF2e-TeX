\chapter{Sections and Cover}

Sections... to organize!

\begin{multicols}{2}

\section{Cover}

The first thing people see is the cover, so you better make it good!
How to make the cover of this book is this:

\begin{verbatim}
\pfMakeCover[
  image = ai-generated-cover-art,
  title = PF2e-\TeX Spellbook,
  subtitle = {Is it a spellbook, or a cheatsheet?}
]
\end{verbatim}

For this you \emph{need} to have an image for the cover.
The title \& subtitle are optional.
This will also put the "Pathfinder Compatible" logo on the cover too.

Alternately, you can just have a cover that is just an image:

\begin{verbatim}
\pfMakeLogoCover[ image = ai-generated-cover-art ]
\end{verbatim}

\section{Parts, chapters, and all that}

The default \LaTeX \verb+\part+, \verb+\chapter+, \verb+\section+, etc... have all been modified.
Feel free to use them as normal, and they will show up looking, well, interesting.
Just to show them off, here they are (minus Part and Chapter):

\section{Section}

\verb+\section{Section}+

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Subsection}

\verb+\subsection{Subsection}+

\lipsum[2]

\subsubsection{Subsubsection}

\paragraph{Paragraph}

\lipsum[4]

\subparagraph{Subparagraph}

\verb+\subparagraph{Subparagraph}+
\lipsum[5]

\section{Subtitle Section}

This is a little thing for emphasized text.
It's meant to be relatively short, so magic items, traps and the like.

\showmacro{\subtitlesection{Magic Item}{It's a cool item, that does MAGIC!}}
