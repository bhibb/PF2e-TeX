\chapter{Intro}

You know how most Paizo products have a cool splash section at the beginning of the chapter before it gets into the nitty-gritty of the text?
Well I haven't implemented anything like that yet!
So be patient while I work on that.

\begin{multicols}{2}

  This is the intro chapter, where I introduce things!
  Most of this is going to be showcasing the different functionality that is built in to these styles.
  Each "chapter" is going to feature a different set of features.
  Feel free to look at the source, at this document, and the others under /docs.
  It will give you an idea of how much of this is intended to work.

  First of all, I recommend not typing everything into one *.tex file.
  For many reasons, but mainly as it is easier to organize your thoughts and whatnot if they are in separate chapters.

  Thus, I do this:

\end{multicols}

\include{docs/actions}
\include{docs/sections}

\end{document}
